\parflow{} \cite{Ashby-Falgout90, Jones-Woodward01, KM06} is a parallel simulation platform that operates in three modes:\begin{enumerate}
\item
steady-state saturated; 
\item
variably saturated; 
\item
and integrated-watershed flow.
\end{enumerate}
\parflow{} is especially suitable for large scale problems on a range
of single and multi-processor computing platforms. \parflow{}
simulates the three-dimensional saturated and variably saturated
subsurface flow in heterogeneous porous media in three spatial
dimensions using a mulitgrid-preconditioned conjugate gradient solver
\cite{Ashby-Falgout90} and a Newton-Krylov nonlinear solver
\cite{Jones-Woodward01}. \parflow{} has recently been extended to
coupled surface-subsurface flow to enable the simulation of hillslope
runoff and channel routing in a truly integrated fashion
\cite{KM06}. \parflow{} is also fully-coupled with the land surface
model \code{CLM} \cite{Dai03} as described in \cite{MM05,KM08a}.  The
development and application of \parflow{} has been on-going for more
than 10 years \cite{KRM10, KRM10, SNSMM10, DMC10, AM10, MLMSWT10, M10, FM10, KMWSVVS10, SMPMPK10, FFKM09, KCSMMB09, MTK09, dBRM08, MK08b, KM08b, KM08a, MK08a, MCT08,MCK07,MWH07,
  KM06, MM05, TMCZPS05, MWT03, Teal02, WGM02, Jones-Woodward01, MCT00,
  TCRM99, TBP99, TFSBA98, Ashby-Falgout90} and resulted in some of the
most advanced numerical solvers and multigrid preconditioners for
massively parallel computer environments that are available
today. Many of the numerical tools developed within the \parflow{}
platform have been turned into or are from libraries that are now
distributed and maintained at LLNL ({\em Hypre} and {\em SUNDIALS},
for example).  An additional advantage of \parflow{} is the use of a
sophisticated octree-space partitioning algorithm to depict complex
structures in three-space, such as topography, different hydrologic
facies, and watershed boundaries. All these components implemented
into \parflow{} enable large scale, high resolution watershed
simulations. \parflow{} simulates the three-dimensional variably
saturated subsurface flow in strongly heterogeneous porous media in
three spatial dimensions.

\parflow{} is primarily written in \emph{C}, uses a module
architecture and contains a flexible communications layer to
encapsolate parallel process interaction on a range of platforms.
\code{CLM} is fully-integrated into \parflow{} as a module and has
been parallelized (including I/O) and is written in \emph{FORTRAN
  90/95}.  \parflow{} is organized into a main executable
\file{\emph{pfdir}/pfsimulator/parflow_exe} and a library
\file{\emph{pfdir}/pfsimulator/parflow\_lib} (where \file{\emph{pfdir}} is
the main directory location) and is comprised of more than 190
separate source files.  \parflow{} is structured to allow it to be
called from within another application (\emph{e.g.} WRF) or as a
stand-alone application.  There is also a directory structure for the
message-passing layer \file{\emph{pfdir}/pfsimulator/amps} for the
associated tools \file{\emph{pfdir}/pftools} for \code{CLM}
\file{\emph{pfdir}/pfsimulator/clm} and a directory of test cases
\file{\emph{pfdir}/test}.

This manual describes how to use \parflow{}, and is intended for
hydrologists, geoscientists, environmental scientists and engineers.  In
Chapter~\ref{Getting Started}, we describe how to install \parflow{}.
Then, we lead the user through a simple \parflow{} run.  In
Chapter~\ref{The ParFlow System}, we describe the \parflow{} system in
more detail.  Chapter~\ref{ParFlow Files} describes the formats of the
various files used by \parflow{}.
