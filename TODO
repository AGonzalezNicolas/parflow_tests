SGS  

There were some compile problems with the CLM F90 and gfortran,
flagged with "SGS" in the CLM directory.  All had to do with file
open/write statements. A couple of the write statements were simply
commented out to get things to compile.

The CLM test is currently broken as it is just a copy of default_richards.
