Update manual to reflect the change to the makefile.   "make install" is now the default behavior.

There were some compile problems with the CLM F90 and gfortran,
flagged with "SGS" in the CLM directory.  All had to do with file
open/write statements. A couple of the write statements were simply
commented out to get things to compile.

The CLM test is currently broken as it is just a copy of default_richards.

CLM test is fixed (thanks more to SGS than RMM) and RMM changed output to reflect new version

The PFMG and SMG solvers should be updated to use the setbox hypre
methods for copying data.   Should speed things up a bit.

Manual: Transient BC time cycle stuff not in user man
Manual: all new test cases (e.g. CLM) not in manual
Manual: all new keys for pftools (top bddy, conversions, silo) not in manual
Manual: new keys for solver PFMG.octree not in manual
Manual: would be nice to have a short section mentioning silo libs and hypre libs
