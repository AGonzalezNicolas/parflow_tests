description: "ParFlow is an open-source, modular, parallel watershed flow model. It\
  \ includes fully-integrated overland flow, the ability to simulate complex topography,\
  \ geology and heterogeneity and coupled land-surface processes including the land-energy\
  \ budget, biogeochemistry and snow (via CLM). It is multi-platform and runs with\
  \ a common I/O structure from laptop to supercomputer. ParFlow is the result of\
  \ a long, multi-institutional development history and is now a collaborative effort\
  \ between CSM, LLNL, UniBonn and UCB. ParFlow has been coupled to the mesoscale,\
  \ meteorological code ARPS and the NCAR code WRF."
