The 'matvec*' files contain source for various versions of the ParFlow
Matvec routine that were tested in an effort to create an optimized
matvec routine that works on general stencils (not just 7-point).

The following routines are C rewrites with the stencil loop on the
inside and outside of the grid loop:

  matvec.c.inside
  matvec.c.outside

The following routines are a C-Fortran rewrite with the stencil loop
on the inside and outside of the grid loop:

  matvec.c.kernels
  matvec_kernels.F.inside
  matvec_kernels.F.outside
