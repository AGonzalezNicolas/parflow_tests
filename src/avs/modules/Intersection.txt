DESCRIPTION

Form of intersection data;
   The intersection data consist of three two component vector in 3D.
   The indicies of the vectors have the flowing layout;

    X_Inter_by_yz(number_of_intersect, y_grid_index, z_grid_index, 0-1)  
    Y_Inter_by_zx(x_grid_index, number_of_intersect, z_grid_index, 0-1)  
    Z_Inter_by_xy(x_grid_index, y_grid_index, number_of_intersect, 0-1)  

     *_grid              -> index of the grid in the * direction.
     number_of_intersect -> index of the intersections
     0-1                 -> vector component, 0 -> solid number, 1 -> intersection value

More details:
  The two components contain the following data;

   X_Inter_by_yz(0,j,k,0) -> total number of x intersections at j,k 
   X_Inter_by_yz(n,j,k,0) -> the geounit index of the nth x intersections at j,k 
	The sign of the about indicates the normal direction of the intersected triangle.
   X_Inter_by_yz(n,j,k,1) -> the x value of the nth x intersections at j,k 

   Y_Inter_by_zx(i,0,k,0) -> total number of y intersections at i,k 
   Y_Inter_by_zx(i,n,k,0) -> the geounit index of the nth y intersections at i,k 
	The sign of the about indicates the normal direction of the intersected triangle.
   Y_Inter_by_zx(i,n,k,1) -> the y value of the nth y intersections at i,k 

   Z_Inter_by_xy(i,j,0,0) -> total number of intersections z intersections at i,j 
   Z_Inter_by_xy(i,j,n,0) -> the geounit index of the nth z intersections at i,j 
	The sign of the about indicates the normal direction of the intersected triangle.
   Z_Inter_by_xy(i,j,n,1) -> the z value of the nth x intersections at i,j 

   N_solids_out -> total number of solids in .fpsol file.
	Note: This is used by subsequent modules to set max on solid slection widgets.
