---------------------------------------------------------
	The Real Math module group is a single file, process-
sharing set of modules that allow basic operations on and 
between integer and real AVS data types.  They have been most
useful in dealing with linkage of several AVS parameters. AVS
has no simple way of performing math operations on reals, even
though it does allow math operations on fields.

The Modules:
-----------

1)	Real Math - This module works with the same interface
as the Field Math module, with two input ports (one required,
one optional), and one output.  If the operation selected from
the control panel is unary, then the required input port is used
as the operand.  If the operation is binary, then both ports are
used if they are both connected.  If only the required port is
connected, then the required port, and the scalar parameter are
used as the two operands.  It is the user's responsibility to
assure that the values sent to this module are in the domain
of the selected function.

2)	Real to Integer - The module simply takes in a real-
valued input port, and passes its truncation to the output port
as an integer.

3)	Integer to Real - The inverse of the above module.

4)	Print real - Creates a widget on the control panel that
will contain the value of the module's input port.


Known Problems/Bugs/Limitations:
-------------------------------

Real Math :  There should be some bounds checking of the input
	operands.
	More operations should be added
Real to Integer : Conversion operators other than truncation
	should be added as options
Integer to real : None known
Print Real : The printout lags behind the actual value by one
	update.
