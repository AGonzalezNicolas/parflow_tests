ParFlow Modules

NAME
     read parflow - read in ParFlow field output files

SUMMARY
     Name          read parflow

     Availability  ParFlow module library

     Type          data input

     Inputs        none

     Outputs       field 3D scalar 3-coord uniform float
                   field 1D scalar 3-coord irregular float

     Parameters    Name          Type       Default       Min       Max
                   File Browser  string     NULL
                   Scan Files    choice     all

DESCRIPTION
     This module reads in parflow-binary (.pfb) and parflow-scattered-
     binary (.pfsb) files based on their file name extensions.  If the
     input file is a `.pfb' file, then the output is a 3D uniform field.
     If the input file is a `.pfsb' file, then the output is both a 3D
     uniform field and a 1D irregular field (scattered data).

     Note: this module assumes that the underlying ParFlow grid is uniform
     and exactly the dimensions of the background grid.

INPUTS

PARAMETERS

     File Browser
          A string specifying the file name to be read.  The browser
          only displays files with the extensions indicated by the
          "Scan Files" parameter below.  Note, the browser file list
          is regenerated only after a directory change.

     Scan Files
          Radio buttons indicating which file extensions will be listed
          in the "File Browser" above.  The current choices are "pfb"
          (`.pfb' files), "pfsb" (`.pfsb files), and "all" (both `.pfb'
          and `.pfsb' files).  Note, when this parameter is changed, the
          file list in the "File Browser" widget above will not be
          immediately updated; the current directory must first be changed.

OUTPUTS

     field 3D scalar 3-coord uniform float
          This output is valid for both `.pfb' and `.pfsb' files.

     field 1D scalar 3-coord irregular float
          This output is valid only for `.pfsb' files.
