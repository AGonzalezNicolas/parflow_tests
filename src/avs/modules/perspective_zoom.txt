NAME 
	perspective_zoom

	
    This coroutine can be used to make zooming in or out
movies. To use perspective_zoom the camera must be set to
perspective. Do this in the Geometry Viewer, click on Cameras,
then Perspective. The camera will zoom from the initial field of
view (FOV init) to the final field of view (FOV fin). These
two parameters are in degrees. The initial point at which
the camera  points is (At X init), (At Y init) and (At Z init).
The finial point is  (At X fin), (At Y fin) and (At Z fin).
These inputs allow some panning during the zoom. The number
of step from initial to final is (steps). The coroutine
is started by the (go) button. Another button is provided
to interchange the initial and final values, this makes
it easy to zoom back to the starting point.
