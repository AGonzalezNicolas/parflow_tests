DESCRIPTION
	The geom parent module allows an interactive user to reparent
	any and all objects in the geometry viewer system.  This is
	useful if you want some objects to move together, but not all.
	The "Group Name" parameter is used to define the group to add
	objects to.  When the "Include Current Object" oneshot is pushed,
	the current object selected within the geometry viewer is reparented
	to the "Group Name". 

	To reparent each object it is necessary for each object to:
	  1. select the object as the current picked object in the
	     geometry viewer.
	  2. push the "Include Current Object" parameter in the
	     geom parent module.
	
	This function can also be done from the cli.
