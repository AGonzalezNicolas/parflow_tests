DESCRIPTION
     The collage module copies two images into an output image.  The
     user can control the position of each of the input images within
     the output image.  The portion of the output image which is not
     covered by either of the input images is set to the value of
     the Gray Fill dial.

     The collage module was originally part of the HIPS image processing
     distribution.  This particular version has been written from 
     scratch to allow for images of varying format.  That is, the
     input images may be grayscale format; single byte, ARGB format;
     four bytes per pixel, complex format; two bytes per pixel.

INPUTS

     Image 1 (required; field uniform 2D byte)
     Image 2 (required; field uniform 2D byte)

     The input images may have differing dimensions.  However, they must
     have the same "veclen" value.  That is, it is en error to try to
     collage a grayscale image (one byte per pixel) with an argb image
     (four bytes per pixel).


PARAMETERS

     Gray Fill
     
     The gray fill parameter specifies the "color" to be used in the
     area of the output image not covered by either of the input images.

OUTPUTS

     Output Image (field uniform 2D byte)
 
     The output image is the result of the collage operation. 

EXAMPLE

1. The first example illustrates how to collage two images into a single image.

     READ IMAGE          READ IMAGE
         |                   |
         +------+   +--------+
                |   |
               COLLAGE
                  |
            DISPLAY IMAGE

2. The second example illustrates how to collage three images into a 
   single image.

     READ IMAGE          READ IMAGE
         |                   |
         +------+   +--------+
                |   |
               COLLAGE       READ IMAGE
                  |              |
                  +----+   +-----+
                       |   |
                      COLLAGE
                         |
                   DISPLAY IMAGE

LIMITATIONS

The lower right corner of the image produced by the collage module always
coincides with the lower right corner of one of the input images.
