DESCRIPTION

   well_to_geom is a utility module for generating well geometries 
   to put one or more wells into an image.  A well is displayed
   as a long rectangle with "pumping regions" enlarged to show where the
   well is actually doing work.

   The input file has the following form:

	100.0 100.0 70.0
	12800.0 12800.0 500.0
	7100.0 7100.0 500.0 200.0 2 240.0 200.0 310.0 330.0
	10000.0 9100.0 500.0 300.0 1 340.0 300.0

  The first two lines are points which define the rectangular 
  domain.

  One or more well specifications follow.  Each well is given by an
  x, y corrdinate pair.  The next two values are a z_upper and z_lower
  pair that specify the extent of the well in the veritcle dimension.
  Each well may have one or more "pumping regions" that should correspond
  to where the well is screened.  This is given by the number of "pumping
  regions" followed by a z_upper, z_lower pair for each region.

  The input field is used to define the number of grid cells for the
  current simulation.  This should be connected to the field that
  is read in by the ReadParflow macro module.
