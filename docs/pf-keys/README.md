# ParFlow/docs/pf-keys/

This directory contains the files necessary to configure and publish the
documentation of ParFlow keys on readthedocs, as they are generated from the
YAML files located in *ParFlow/pf-keys/definitions*.

To generate the key documentation, run the following command:

        make GenerateKeysRST

This will generate the *parflow_keys.rst* file in this directory.
