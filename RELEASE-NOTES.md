# ParFlow Release Notes 3.10.0
-----------------------------

ParFlow improvements and bug-fixes would not be possible without
contributions of the ParFlow community.  Thank you for all the great
contributions.

Note : Version 3.10.0 is a minor update to v3.9.0.  These release notes cover 
changes made in 3.10.0

## Overview of Changes

* Python PFB reader/writer updated

## User Visible Changes

### Python: PFB reader/writer updated

Add simple and fast pure-python based readers and writers of PFB files, done by myself and Bill Hasling (@wh3248). This eliminates the need for the external ParflowIO dependency. Implemented a new backend for the xarray package that let's you open both .pfb files as well as .pfmetadata files directly into xarray datastructures. These are very useful for data wrangling and scientific analysis

Basic usage of the new functionality:

```
import parflow as pf

# Read a pfb file as numpy array:
x = pf.read_pfb('/path/to/file.pfb')

# Read a pfb file as an xarray dataset:
ds = xr.open_dataset('/path/to/file.pfb', name='example')

# Write a pfb file with distfile:
pf.write_pfb('/path/to/new_file.pfb', x, 
             p=p, q=q, r=r, dist=True)
```

### Python: SolidFileBuilder simplification

Support simple use case in SolidFileBuilder when all work can simply be delegated to pfmask-to-pfsol
Added a generate_asc_files (default False) argument to SolidFileBuilder.write 

## Bug Fixes

### Python: interface fixed issue where some keys failed to set when unless set in a particular order

1) Update some documentation for contributing to pf-keys
2) Fix a bugs found in pf-keys where some keys failed to set when unless set in a particular order
3) Add constraint for lists of names

This change lets us express that one list of names should be a subset of another list of names
Constraint Example

Values for PhaseSources.{phase_name}.GeomNames should be a subset of values from either GeomInput.{geom_input_name}.GeomNames or GeomInput.{geom_input_name}.GeomName. Setting the domain to EnumDomain like so expresses that constraint. A more detailed example can be seen in this test case.

## Internal/Developer Changes

### Core: Diverting ParFlow output to stream

Added new method for use when ParFlow is embedded in another application to control the file stream used for ParFlow logging messages. In the embedded case will be disabled by default unless redirected by the calling application.

Change required to meet IDEAS Watersheds best practices.

### Python: Add keys and generator for Simput

Added keys and generator to allow use Simput and applications based on Simput to write inputs for parflow with a graphical web interface.

### Core: Remove use of MPI_COMM_WORLD 

Enable use of a communicator other than MPI_COMM_WORLD for more general embedding.
Meet IDEAS Watersheds best practices policy.
